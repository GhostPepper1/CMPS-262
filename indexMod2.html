		<p>I am a senior at Point Park University. I am just 3 classes away from finally getting my Bachelor's in Information Technology, or Applied Computer Science,<br>depending 
		on when that change occurs.  I am 42 years old, I am from Mercer,
		Pennsylvania, and I have been working at an outpatient mental health clinic as the <br>I.T. and Billing Manager for a little over 15 years.  <br><br>Since football
	    came up in one of Professor Seaman's videos (Ravens hate, haha), I'll mention that I am a Bears fan.  In fact, here's a picture of my sister and me<br> in Chicago last
		Summer at the Bears 100 celebration:</p>
