    <p>I am a senior at Point Park University. I am just 3 classes away from finally getting my Bachelor's in Information Technology, or Applied Computer Science, depending 
		on when that change occurs.  <br>I am 42 years old, I am from Mercer,
	    Pennsylvania, and I have been working at an outpatient mental health clinic as the I.T. and Billing Manager <br>for a little over 15 years.  <br>Since football
	    came up in one of Professor Seaman's videos (Ravens hate, haha), I'll mention that I am a Bears fan.  In fact, here's a picture of me and my sister<br> in Chicago this
	    past Summer at the Bears 100 celebration:</p>

	<p>I will be taking the Data structures course in the Fall II term and then I will be finished and ready to graduate.  
		I can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:mwsmith@pointpark.edu">mwsmith@pointpark.edu</a> or 
		at <a href="mailto:monkeysandwombats@gmail.com">monkeysandwombats@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <p>As far as courses, I am taking my senior project class right now as well and then I just have to grab Data Structures when it is offered next and I am done.</p>
