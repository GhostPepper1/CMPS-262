    <p>I am a senior at Point Park University.  I am just 2 classes and a senior project away from
	    finally getting my Bachelor's in Information Technology, or Applied Computer Science, <br>depending on when that change occurs.  <br>I am 42 years old, I am from Mercer,
	    Pennsylvania, and I have been working at an outpatient mental health clinic as the I.T. and Billing Manager <br>for a little over 15 years.  <br>Since football
	    came up in one of Professor Seaman's videos (Ravens hate, haha), I'll mention that I am a Bears fan.  In fact, here's a picture of me and my sister<br> in Chicago this
	    past Summer at the Bears 100 celebration:</p>
