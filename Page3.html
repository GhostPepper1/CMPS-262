			I have copied your code exactly and tried other code from other sources but I cannot
			figure out what the problem is.  My word "left" in line 9 and "position:absolute" in line
			23 are not red and green like yours and I don't know why.  If you could let me know what
			I'm missing, I would appreciate it.</p>
